Introduction

TMDB.org is a crowd-sourced movie information database used by many film-related consoles, sites and apps, such as XBMC, MythTV and Plex. Dozens of media managers, mobile apps and social sites make use of its API. This is dataset of the 10,000 most popular movies across the world has been fetched through the read API. TMDB's free API provides for developers and their team to programmatically fetch and use TMDb's data.Their API is to use as long as you attribute TMDb as the source of the data and/or images. Also, they update their API from time to time.
This data set is fetched using exception handling process so the data set contains some null values as there are missing fields in the tmdb database. Thought it's good for a young analyst to deal with messing value.
